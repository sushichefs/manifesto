# Sushi Manifesto

Sushi began with the dream of building a platform where control was shared between the team of builders and the adopters of the platform. As Sushi's initial goal was to build a prosperous decentralized exchange, this meant offering its governance to the liquidity providers in the form of a token. 

It was a simple idea, award governance and oversight to the liquidity providers who chose to take a chance on a fledgling operation without the illustrious track record of Uniswap.

Many were intrigued and contributed. The bull market was beginning to pick up steam, and token values became highly speculative. In this environment, it became more about profiting on the token's price rather than simple governance. The potential gains from selling the governance token on the speculative market led to many liquidity providers treating Sushi as an additional stream of income rather than a DEX that they could help shape with their voting rights. And so, the protocol slipped, in part, away from decentralized ownership.

While there is nothing truly wrong with the notion of a centralized controlling body running a protocol used by the masses, it is much easier for such a structure to lose sight of the purpose of DeFi.

DeFi is about decentralizaion, but not only with respect to contracts and blockchains. It is about a collective effort to shape something better than legacy finance that someday will be accessible to everyone. Collectively we should participate in shaping communities around the protocols we value in order to help guide and direct their objectives. The teams toil away building but why? There is a love for establishing new ground and not simply extracting profit. The best teams are comprised of the degen-devs that are looking to solve a problem for themselves and ultimately others. And so, they value the insights of those who participate in this space. 

This is why good governance matters and should be established. Centralized governance stagnates into a business-to-client relationship that treats the users of the protocol as a source of profit rather than participants. Maximum extracted value is not the future of DeFi.

The relationship between team and community should be mutually beneficial. Ideally there should be trust and cooperation. But there also needs to be established rules of governance to help structure the collective will of those involved. Balance needs to exist to ensure this relationship is successful.

The DAO is intended to be the tool of this structured relationship. But it is not simply about voting on proposed changes. There must also be channels of communication to keep the community and team synchronized on anything that requires the collective attention. Decision-making is the action that is taken, but there is more to the process.

An effective DAO will provide the structure for the community to uphold its responsibility to the protocol. Discussions and disagreements are a part of this, but the end result is to put matters to a vote. With true decentralization these votes reflect what the people want and will not be skewed towards a direction that favours only a few of the participants. The protocol is kept honest by the varying interests of the participants who should have, at a minimum, one point of intersection: *The DAO and that which stems from it.*
